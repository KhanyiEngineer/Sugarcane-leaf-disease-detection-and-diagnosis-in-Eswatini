# Sugarcane-leaf-disease-detection-and-diagnosis-in-Eswatini
Research based on applying deep learning/AI to detect and diagnose sugarcane leaf diseases in the Kingdom of Eswatini

This project is a deep learning-based system designed to detect diseases on Sugarcane leaves disease It uses the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection model to perform real-time detection on uploaded images. The system is built using Python, Flask for the backend API, and YOLOv8 for the object detection model.
